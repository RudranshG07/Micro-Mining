- [ ] Current round ID
- [ ] Contract STX balance
- [ ] Active round status
- [ ] Individual miner data

**API Verification:**
```bash
# Check contract stats
curl "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/contract/[ADDRESS]/depin-mining/read-only/get-contract-stats"

# Check miner info  
curl "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/contract/[ADDRESS]/depin-mining/read-only/get-miner-info?arg0=[MINER_ADDRESS]"
```

---

## **🔒 Security & Edge Cases**

### **✅ Access Control**
- [ ] Only contract owner can start/end rounds
- [ ] Non-owners cannot call admin functions
- [ ] Users can only register once
- [ ] Users cannot commit without registration
