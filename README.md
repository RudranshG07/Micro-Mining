# 🚀 Stacks Mining-as-a-DePIN

> **Democratizing blockchain mining through small devices and fair participation**

A revolutionary hackathon project that transforms Stacks blockchain mining into a **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)** where anyone with a phone, laptop, or IoT device can participate in fair, community-driven mining.

## 🎯 **Vision Statement**
*"Making blockchain mining accessible to everyone with any connected device, creating a truly decentralized mining ecosystem powered by everyday hardware."*

## ⚡ **The Problem We Solve**

Traditional Stacks mining (Proof of Transfer) favors those with significant capital to commit BTC. Our DePIN model instead:

- ✅ **Enables** anyone with small devices to participate
- ✅ **Creates** fair lottery-based reward distribution  
- ✅ **Demonstrates** community-driven mining at scale
- ✅ **Shows** how DePIN can strengthen blockchain networks

## 🛠️ **Technical Architecture**

### Smart Contract (Clarity)
- **Device Registration**: Miners register their devices for 1 STX
- **Mining Commitments**: Submit computational work + stake STX
- **Fair Lottery**: Block-height based randomness for winner selection
- **Reward Distribution**: Winner-takes-all reward pool system

### Frontend Dashboard (Next.js + React)
- **Real-time Mining Stats**: Live network statistics
- **Device Management**: Register and manage mining devices
- **Mining Interface**: Submit commitments and track participation
- **Leaderboard**: Track rewards and mining history

### Demo Mode
- **Standalone HTML**: Experience the full flow without blockchain setup
- **Simulated Mining**: Real-time activity simulation
- **Interactive UI**: Complete mining experience for judges

## 🎮 **Live Demo**

### Option 1: Instant Demo (Recommended for Judges)
```bash
# Open the standalone demo
open demo.html
```
*Experience the complete mining flow with simulated blockchain interactions*

### Option 2: Full Blockchain Integration
```bash
# Smart Contract Testing
cd mining-depin-contract
npm install
clarinet check           # Verify contract syntax
npm test                # Run contract tests

# Frontend Application  
cd depin-mining-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev             # Launch at http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎭 **Hackathon Demo Flow**

1. **Open `demo.html`** - Instant live experience
2. **Register a device** (e.g., "MacBook-Pro-M2")
3. **Generate hash effort** - Simulates device computation
4. **Commit mining effort** - Stake STX and submit work
5. **Watch live feed** - See other miners joining automatically
6. **Win rewards** - Experience the lottery selection
