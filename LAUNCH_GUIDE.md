## **⚡ Launch Sequence**

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup** *(5 minutes)*
```bash
# Verify prerequisites
node --version     # Should be v18+
npm --version      # Should be v8+

# Install Leather wallet extension
# Visit: https://leather.io
```

### **Phase 2: Get Testnet STX** *(5 minutes)*
1. **Open Leather wallet**
2. **Switch to Testnet** (Settings → Network → Testnet)
3. **Copy your address**
4. **Visit faucet:** https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet
5. **Request STX** (you'll get ~1000 testnet STX)

### **Phase 3: Deploy Smart Contract** *(10 minutes)*
Choose one method:

**Option A: Clarinet Console**
```bash
cd mining-depin-contract
clarinet console --testnet
```
Then paste contract code and deploy.

**Option B: Stacks Explorer**
- Visit: https://explorer.hiro.so/sandbox/contract-deploy?chain=testnet
- Connect Leather, paste contract code, deploy

### **Phase 4: Launch Frontend** *(5 minutes)*
```bash
cd depin-mining-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Update contract address** in `src/app/page.tsx` line 19 with your deployed contract.

### **Phase 5: Test Complete Flow** *(10 minutes)*
1. Connect Leather wallet
2. Register device (1 STX fee)
3. Generate hash effort  
4. Commit mining (0.1+ STX)
5. End round (admin only)
6. Verify reward distribution

## **🚨 Important Notes**

### **Testnet vs Mainnet**
- **Current:** Testnet deployment (free STX)
- **Production:** Ready for mainnet with security audit
- **Costs:** Testnet is free, mainnet costs real money

### **Security Considerations**
- Winner selection is simplified for demo
- Production needs VRF for true randomness  
- Consider additional access controls for mainnet
- Audit recommended before real value deployment

### **Performance**
- Testnet can be slow (10-15 minutes per transaction)
- Mainnet is faster but costs real STX
- System designed for high throughput
